# Neuron

It is a Neural Network Architecture which uses **Forward Backward Propagation**


# Overview

  - Given a Data Set, the architecture finds the best *learning rate, epoch values and number of hidden layers needed*
  - It uses Forward Backward Propagation.
  - The activation function used is sigmoid.
  - Based on the selected parameters, the data is classified and the prediction rate is further analyzed.

# Dataset Used
- Car Evaluation : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/car+evaluation

- Mushroom Data set : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom


# Neural Structure
This is a sample neural structure with 6 inputs, 6 neurons with 1 hidden layer and 4 output.

# Data Set Preprocessing

- All the *numerical attributes* were scaled using min max scaler, to have the same range *0-1*
- All the categorical values were label encoded and then scaled.
